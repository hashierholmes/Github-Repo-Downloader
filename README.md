# GitHub Repo Downloader

[screenshot](screenshot.jpg)

Lists all your public and private GitHub repositories and lets you select and download them as ZIP files.

## Why I Made This
Because I'm just too lazy to download all my repositories one by one.

## Setup
1. Generate a **classic token** with `repo` scope.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Enter your GitHub username and token.
4. Click **Load Repositories**, select the ones you want, or use **Select All**, then hit **Download Selected**.

> Tip: Enable “multiple downloads” in your browser settings if it asks, so it won’t block the files.
